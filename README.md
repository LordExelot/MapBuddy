# MapBuddy
Tool for Elden Ring map edits. 

## Entity ID Tool
Allows you to add an unique ID to all enemies within a map. Can be used on Assets, Enemies or Players.
You can configure the ID range used for the unique IDs, and whether it replaces existing IDs.

## Entity Group ID tool
Allows you to add a Entity Group ID at a specified index within a map. Can be used on Assets or Enemies.
Can be configured to only apply based on ModelName for Assets. For enemies, it can be configured to only apply based on ModelName or NPCParam.

## Enemy Duplication
Allows you to duplicate enemies within a map. You can control which enemies are duplicated with the inclusion and exclusion filters, or use the preset filters to exclusion bosses, passive, script or player type enemies.

## Data Export
Allows you to export MSB data for a map as a CSV file.

Which properties are exported can be toggled, and the output can be either one big file with a Map ID column, or split by map name.
